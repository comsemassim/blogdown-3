      <description>Today I failed. I’m not used to failing, usually I’m pretty good at stuff and honestly I’m very dissapointed at myself.
Let me give you some context. I am a master’s student and I’m at a congress right now. What happened is that I had had 1 submitted an abstract to the scientific committe and it was accepted in the abstract category. It wasn’t clear if I shoul make a banner of an presentation so I sent an email to the organizing committee and received no reply, a week later I sent another email and still no response.</description>
