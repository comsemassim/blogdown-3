      <description>I used to have an updated tumblr where I posted pictures and texts from my adventures in throughout the world and neighboring countries. I stopped doing that because uni life was getting hard and I was having trouble keeping it up.
So in the next weeks (or weekends) I’ll be uploading my tumblr posts here and to start things up I’ll see if i can importgraphics in a way that looks beautiful and practical.</description>
