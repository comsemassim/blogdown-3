# Who I Am

My full name is Lucas Chagas Lima do Carmo.
I am a person who can't really decide what I want for my life. 

* I like listening and playing music but neve enough to consider myself an 'ok' musician

* I like sports and played (in a team) basketball for at least 10 years of my life

* I like programming even though I'm not proficient in it, yet.

* I like taking photographs

* I like wathcing movies and I have the hability of remembering plots of most of the movies I see. 

# Why I Am

I really don't know my purpose in life. Maybe I have no purpose and neither do you, that being said, I am a pharmacist and finishing my master's in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil, and THAT being said, my research project is not related to any health issue which is frustrating but not disencouraging.

Eventually I'd like to work with `ML` and epidemiology.
