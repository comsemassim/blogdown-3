<p>I used to have an updated <a href="comsemassim.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> where I posted pictures and texts
from my adventures in throughout the world and neighboring countries. I stopped doing that because uni life was getting
hard and I was having trouble keeping it up.</p>
<p>So in the next weeks (or weekends) I’ll be uploading my tumblr posts here and to start things up I’ll see if i can
<code>importgraphics</code> in a way that looks beautiful and practical.</p>

<p>This photo was taken for a weekly photography challenge, the <a href="https://dogwood.photography">dogwood challenge</a>.
It is a 52 week challenge with 3 categories: <em>story telling</em>, <em>compositional eye</em> and <em>inspiration</em>, they change every year
and if I recall correctly photo <a href="#fig:carros">1</a> was taken as part of the <em>compositional eye</em> category, and I was supposed
to elaborate on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors">complementary colors</a>.</p>
<p>To my surprise I found a blue car amidst the taxis and clicked.</p>
<p>As i said, in the comming weeks I’ll update the site to include previous posts from my old tumblr and hope whomever is reading this likes it.</p>
