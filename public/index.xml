The Brazilian guys and I took a Sunday to go to this beach on Mount Martha around 60km away from the city. It took us a tad more than 2 hours to get there. It was easy enough, just have to get the Frankston train in any of the Stations on the CBD and then get on the 781 bus to Mount Martha on bay 4 at Frankston Station.</description>

We had a break from uni. It lasted one weekend, I believe it was Easter. What this means is that everyone wants to go away, travel to Tasmania, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, whichever. Things that I should have done but instead I wanted to enjoy the beauties the great State of Victoria could offer.
 Figure 1: Kensington Station  Friday I took the train to go see Emanuel and Nada at their home and we left for the camp in Elmore.</description>

This is it, I thought as I was landing in Sydney. Suddenly my heart filled with emotion as I looked through the window and saw the Pacific Ocean for the first time. I had spent at least 30 hours inside a plane so I can’t tell if my eyes where watering because of sentiment or exhaustion but then again, it didn’t mattered. I had finally arrived.</description>

It was a common Saturday morning. I woke up, had breakfast and got ready to go to church. We went to the Polish church in Dandenong where the wedding was held a week ago. So far so good. Nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
It happens that Emanuel has a childhood friend (if i can put it in those words) and he lives in Warragul.</description>

      <description>I used to have an updated tumblr where I posted pictures and texts from my adventures in throughout the world and neighboring countries. I stopped doing that because uni life was getting hard and I was having trouble keeping it up.
So in the next weeks (or weekends) I’ll be uploading my tumblr posts here and to start things up I’ll see if i can importgraphics in a way that looks beautiful and practical.</description>

      <description>This week I had the job to teach some pharmacy undergraduate students viscosity. I had one 2 hour theoretical lecture and three 4 hour practical class. The objective of the class was to teach fluid behavior as well as some methods and equipment used to measure viscosity. I started with flow curves and ideally liquid and ideally solid materials. I did not go through viscoelasticity at all, except for the Kelvin-Voight, Maxwell and Burguers.</description>

      <description>I am really pissed, let me tell you why.
the banner quest I’m at this congress in Fortaleza - Ceará - Brazil 1 and it was really not helpful on my research. I’m studying cosmetics rheology and most of the lectures were about asphalt and binding agents for pavements. That put aside I’ve had to create a banner out of thin air within 24 hours to present my work that i found out that was indeed accepted like i mentioned on the last post Failure</description>

      <description>Today I failed. I’m not used to failing, usually I’m pretty good at stuff and honestly I’m very dissapointed at myself.
Let me give you some context. I am a master’s student and I’m at a congress right now. What happened is that I had had 1 submitted an abstract to the scientific committe and it was accepted in the abstract category. It wasn’t clear if I shoul make a banner of an presentation so I sent an email to the organizing committee and received no reply, a week later I sent another email and still no response.</description>

      <description>Who I Am My full name is not important. I am a person who can&amp;rsquo;t really decide what I want for my life.
 I like listening and playing music but never enough to consider myself an &amp;lsquo;ok&amp;rsquo; musician
 I like sports and played (in a team) basketball for at least 10 years of my life
 I like programming even though I&amp;rsquo;m not proficient in it, yet (learning R, python javascript and latex at the moment.</description>

      <description>First post I started this blog this day.
I have links for social media. Most of it is in portuguese, since I’m Brazillian. The main objective of the blog is to post pictures and some data exploration as I’m into learning data science.
Photos My photos are most likely hosted on flickr and you’ll be able to check it out by clicking on the icon on the sidebar.1
 Equations One of the reasons I choose to use R and the blogdown package was because I’m a little familiar with Rmarkdown language and this way I have support to \(\LaTeX\) equations such as \(E = mc^2\).</description>
