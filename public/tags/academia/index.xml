      <description>This week I had the job to teach some pharmacy undergraduate students viscosity. I had one 2 hour theoretical lecture and three 4 hour practical class. The objective of the class was to teach fluid behavior as well as some methods and equipment used to measure viscosity. I started with flow curves and ideally liquid and ideally solid materials. I did not go through viscoelasticity at all, except for the Kelvin-Voight, Maxwell and Burguers.</description>

      <description>I am really pissed, let me tell you why.
the banner quest I’m at this congress in Fortaleza - Ceará - Brazil 1 and it was really not helpful on my research. I’m studying cosmetics rheology and most of the lectures were about asphalt and binding agents for pavements. That put aside I’ve had to create a banner out of thin air within 24 hours to present my work that i found out that was indeed accepted like i mentioned on the last post Failure</description>
