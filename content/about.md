# Who I Am

My full name is not important.
I am a person who can't really decide what I want for my life. 

* I like listening and playing music but never enough to consider myself an 'ok' musician

* I like sports and played (in a team) basketball for at least 10 years of my life

* I like programming even though I'm not proficient in it, yet (learning `R`, `python` `javascript` and `latex` at the moment.)

* I like taking photographs

* I like watching movies and I have the useless ability of remembering plots of most of the movies I see. 

# Why I Am

I really don't know my purpose in life. Maybe I have no purpose and neither do you, that being said, I am a pharmacist and finishing my master's in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the Federal University of Paran√° in Brazil, and THAT being said, my research project is not related to any health issue which is frustrating but not discouraging.

Eventually I'd like to work with `ML` and epidemiology.
