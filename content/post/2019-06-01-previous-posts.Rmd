I used to have an updated [tumblr](comsemassim.tumblr.com) where I posted pictures and texts
from my adventures in throughout the world and neighboring countries. I stopped doing that because uni life was getting
hard and I was having trouble keeping it up.

So in the next weeks (or weekends) I'll be uploading my tumblr posts here and to start things up I'll see if i can
`importgraphics` in a way that looks beautiful and practical.

```{r carros, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Taken in Curitiba", out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://live.staticflickr.com/4699/25769231668_f7f86c9046_b_d.jpg")
```

This photo was taken for a weekly photography challenge, the [dogwood challenge](https://dogwood.photography).
It is a 52 week challenge with 3 categories: *story telling*, *compositional eye* and *inspiration*, they change every year
and if I recall correctly photo \@ref(fig:carros) was taken as part of the *compositional eye* category, and I was supposed
to elaborate on [complementary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors).

To my surprise I found a blue car amidst the taxis and clicked.

As i said, in the comming weeks I'll update the site to include previous posts from my old tumblr and hope whomever is reading this likes it.
