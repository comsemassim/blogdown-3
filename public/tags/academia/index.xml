      <description>I am really pissed, let me tell you why.
the banner questI’m at this congress in Fortaleza - Ceará - Brazil 1 and it was really not helpful on my research. I’m studying cosmetics rheology and most of the lectures were about asphalt and binding agents for pavements. That put aside I’ve had to create a banner out of thin air within 24 hours to present my work that i found out that was indeed accepted like i mentioned on the last post Failure</description>
