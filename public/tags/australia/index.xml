This is it, I thought as I was landing in Sydney. Suddenly my heart filled with emotion as I looked through the window and saw the Pacific Ocean for the first time. I had spent at least 30 hours inside a plane so I can’t tell if my eyes where watering because of sentiment or exhaustion but then again, it didn’t mattered. I had finally arrived.</description>

      <description>It was a common Saturday morning. I woke up, had breakfast and got ready to go to church. We went to the Polish church in Dandenong where the wedding was held a week ago. So far so good. Nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
It happens that Emanuel has a childhood friend (if i can put it in those words) and he lives in Warragul. Now, this city is 104 km away from Melbourne so it took us a little more than an hour to get there.</description>
